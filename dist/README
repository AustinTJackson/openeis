On older versions of Ubuntu, it may be necessary to enable the deadsnakes PPA
to install Python 3.3 or newer. Only perform this step if Python 3.3 or newer
is unavailable in the official repositories for the version of Ubuntu you are
using. The easiest way to enable the PPA is to execute the following command:

   $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes

Some firewalls may block the request to the PGP key server. In that case, the
repository may be installed directly from the deadsnakes-ppa directory:

   $ sudo apt-key add deadsnakes-ppa/deadsnakes-ppa.key
   $ sudo cp deadsnakes/deadsnakes-ppa.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/

Alternatively, the deadsnakes-ppa package can be built and installed:

   $ (cd deadsnakes-ppa && dpkg-buildpackage -tc -b)
   $ sudo dpkg -i deadsnakes-ppa_1.0_all.deb

More information on the deadsnakes PPA can be found here:

Nginx version 1.4 or newer is recommended and is generally not in the official
repositories, so it will likely be necessary to enable the nginx repository.
The easiest method for enabling the repository is to build and install the
nginx-repo package:

   $ (cd nginx-repo && dpkg-buildpackage -tc -b)
   $ sudo dpkg -i nginx-keys_1.0_all.deb nginx-stable_1.0_all.deb

You may also follow the instructions on the Nginx website to install it
manually:

   http://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html


Now that the appropriate Python and Nginx repositories are available, the
openeis-support packages must be built and installed:

   $ (cd openeis-support && dpkg-buildpackage -tc -b)
   $ sudo dpkg -i openeis-support*.deb
   $ sudo apt-get update
   $ sudo apt-get install -f

openeis-support expects the openeis-repository to be checked out and built in
/var/lib/openeis. The directory is owned by openeis and has a sticky group of
openeis. This means that any files and directories created in will have their
group automatically set to openeis and be writable by all members of openeis.

To make ensure there are no permission issues, perform the following steps
as theopeneis user, which was created by the openeis-support-config package:

   $ sudo su -l -s /bin/bash openeis

Check out the code into /var/lib/openeis:

   [openeis /var/lib/openeis]$ git clone \
      https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/openeis.git .

Bootstrap OpenEIS and install extra python dependencies:

   [openeis /var/lib/openeis]$ python3 bootstrap.py
   [openeis /var/lib/openeis]$ env/bin/pip install uwsgi psycopg2
   [openeis /var/lib/openeis]$ env/bin/openeis syncdb
   [openeis /var/lib/openeis]$ env/bin/openeis linkstatic
   [openeis /var/lib/openeis]$ exit

Now start the openeis service:

   $ sudo initctl start openeis

And restart nginx to ensure it picks up the changes:

   $ sudo service nginx restart
