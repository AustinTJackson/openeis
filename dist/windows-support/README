INTRODUCTION

These utility scripts are useful for downloading numpy and scipy Windows
superpack installers and converting them to wheels suitable for installing into
a virtual environment using pip.


REQUIREMENTS

Python packages:

  wheel
  setuptools (pkg_resources)

Utilities:

  7z (7zip)


USAGE

Download:

Use getsuperpack.py script to download either numpy or scipy installers.

  python getsuperpack.py numpy|scipy [VERSION]

The script will automatically grab the latest version of the package compatible
with the version of Python used to execute the script. An optional version
number may be provided as a second argument to force downloading of a
particular version. Use the -l option to fetch and print a list of available
versions. Other options are available and may be displayed using the --help
option.

There is also an undocumented option, --no-filter, that will list or fetch
packages regardless of their compatibility with the current Python. This option
is useful for fetching Windows packages from Linux or OS-X.

Convert:

Use superpack2wheel.py to convert the Windows executable (.exe) installer to a
Python wheel (.whl) archive.

  python superpack2wheel.py INSTALLER

Simply provide the executable, downloaded with getsuperpack.py or via a web
browser, and a wheel file will be generated next to the executable. The sse3
version is extracted by default, but sse2 and nosse wheels can be extracted
using the --sse2 and --nosse options. Use the --help option for usage details,
including other helpful options.

Install:

Install extracted wheel files using pip.

  pip install WHEEL
