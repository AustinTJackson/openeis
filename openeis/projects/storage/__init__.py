    Get sensors returns a list of two-tuples.   The first element in the
    tuple will be a meta object that will hold the mapping definition and
    the sensor definition.  The second element will be a function that will
    take no arguments and will return a new queryset.  The queryset will hold
    two columns of data, the time and the data point value.
