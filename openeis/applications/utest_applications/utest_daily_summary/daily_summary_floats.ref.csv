Load Max Intensity [W/sf],1.67,"The daily maximum usage could be dominated by a single large load, or could be the sum of several smaller ones. Long periods of usage near the maximum increase overall energy use."
Load Min Intensity [W/sf],0.37,"Minimum usage is often dominated by loads that run 24 hours a day. In homes, these include refrigerators and vampire loads. In commercial buildings, these include ventilation, hallway lighting, computers, and vampire loads."
Daily Load 95th Percentile [kW],5,"Another way of calculating the peak load, which excludes extreme data points."
Daily Load 5th Percentile [kW],1.1,"Another way of calculating the base load, which excludes extreme data points."
Daily Load Ratio,0.22,"Values over 0.33 indicate that significant loads are shut off for parts of the day. To save energy, look to extend and deepen shutoff periods, while also reducing peak energy use."
Daily Load Range [kW],3.9,"This is a rough estimate of the total load turned on and off every day. Higher values may indicate good control, but could also indicate excessive peak usage."
Load Variability,0.48,"This metric is used to understand regularity of operations, and the likelihood of consistency in the buildingâ€™s demand responsiveness. It gives a coefficient of variation that ranges from 0 to 1. This coefficient can be interpreted based on general guidelines. For example, variability above 0.15 is generally considered high for commercial buildings."
Peak Load Benchmark [W/sf],1.67,"This is the absolute maximum electric load based on all of your data. The median for commercial buildings under 150,000 sf is 4.4 W/sf. Values much higher than 4.4 therefore indicate an opportunity to improve building performance."
